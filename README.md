Write code to help rescue animals get adopted by allowing visitors to view which pets are available to meet.
Achieved the above goal by following the steps below:
1) Create a factory function that accepts each animal's name, species, and tiredness as parameters.
2) Write methods to indicate each animal's status so visitors know who they can interact with (Is animal sleeping or awake?).
3) Create five animals available for adoption.
4) Verify all objects were created and methods work.
Now, I use the pet data to populate the web page.
6) Update properties and create an array of objects(animals).
7) Display the pets in the browser and their status for visiting when visitor clicks a button.

One point that I had reinforced was when to use the "this" keyword versus when it should not be used.
